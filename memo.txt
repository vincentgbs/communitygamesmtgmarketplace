This is an application built on Laravel 5, but not in Laravel.
Some examples:
1. I did not use migrations but instead just placed a sequel dump within the database folder.
2. I also did not use Eloquent because of my familiarity with MySql.
3. I created custom get and post functions within the controller class for filtering user input.
etc.

I created a clean repository with my last version of the project because some of my previous commits included personal data.

There's a couple quickly-hacked (sloppy) solutions that I didn't bother to work on (I tried to comment most of them), but overall, this is a working marketplace with the ability to register as users and buy and sell products.
It was designed to allow for the "easiest" buyer interface possible.

This set up was tested and working on a local environment with VirtualBox (version 4.3.28r100309), on homestead (version 0.2.6).
Specs running within VirtualBox:
Linux homestead 3.16.0-23-generic #31-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 21 17:56:17 UTC 2014 x86_64
Ubuntu 14.10 (GNU/Linux 3.16.0-23-generic x86_64)
PHP Version 5.6.7-1+deb.sury.org~utopic+1
