Buyer Agreement
    Due to the volitile price of our products, our sellers are not obligated to offer returns.

    To maintain a fair market for buyers, sellers are obligated to ship/cancel orders within 2 business days of notification of payment. Seller-cancelled orders may be subject to review and punishment if a buyer files a complaint.
        Legitimate reasons for cancelling orders:
            1. Item is lost, damaged or destroyed.
            2. Seller is unavailable to ship in time. (This is left to the buyer's discretion if they still want the product).
            3. Buyer does not pay

    All arbitration from this marketplace will be final for both buyers and sellers.

Seller Agreement:
    Arbitration is managed by this marketplace.

    Sellers agree to receive payment on their selected payment cycle.

    Sellers agree that the marketplace will take the applicable fee for payment processing and order handling.

    Sellers agree to ship orders in a timely manner.


    ColorCreep makes all attempts to pay sellers by 5PM Pacific time on Fridays, but we do reserve the right in extreme circumstances to pre-pay, or delay pay, by one business day.

    Priority Mail
    If you support Priority Mail, you must confirm and ship orders by the next business day. You can adjust your preference to do so here.

    Failure to confirm orders
    If the seller doesn't confirm an order in 3 business days, the buyer can cancel the order for up to 30 days. If buyer cancels the order during this period, seller is then placed on vacation automatically and will receive an email regarding the cancellation. Be proactive if you cannot fill an order, and either cancel your self or contact our service team to cancel instead of waiting for the buyer to do so.

    Cancellation of confirmed orders
    We expect that sellers have, and are ready to ship, cards they are selling. If a confirmed order needs to be canceled without good reason, the seller will be responsible for a 3% cancellation fee. This fee will be carried as a negative balance on your account and deducted from your next payment.


    Delayed payments
    ColorCreep may delay payments to sellers who have open customer service complaints, until the seller makes a sincere attempt to resolve the issue(s). If a seller has repeated complaints from customers that are not resolved satisfactorily, selling privileges will be revoked.

    Transaction feedback
    Feedback ratings on transactions are changed through requests from the buyer. If you feel you were awarded a rating that wasn't justified, try to contact your buyer and ask that they reconsider. Ratings that include threats, profanity, outrageous, or slanderous statements will be removed at the discretion of the support team.
